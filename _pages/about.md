Zheng Chen (陈峥), I am a Specially Appointed Assistant Professor with [ISIR, Osaka University](https://www.sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/), in the [Department of Translational Datability (Sakurai&Matsubara Group)](https://www.dm.sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp).
I received MSc and Ph.D. degrees from NAIST in October 2019 and March 2022, respectively. 
My research interests lie in data representation, knowledge-based modeling, and biomedical engineering. 
My research aims to explore a reliable form of automated biomedical systems designed on top of prior knowledge and practical consideration. 
I focus on neurodynamic cognition, cancers, and cardiovascular diseases by merging deep learning architectures with information theory.
