Welcome to the AI for Health Group at [SANKEN, Osaka University](https://www.sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/). [Dr. Zheng Chen (陈峥)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=571LAh4AAAAJ&hl=en) is a Specially Appointed Associate Professor, part of [Sakurai & Matsubara Lab](https://www.dm.sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp) at SANKEN, Osaka University. His research combines machine learning, signal processing, and biomedical science to build reliable AI for biological and clinical applications. We develop systems grounded in prior knowledge and practical constraints — moving beyond benchmark performance toward methods that are interpretable, robust, and deployable in real clinical and biological workflows.

**Research directions:**
- EEG & Biosignals — disease predictive modeling, brain dynamic modeling, neuromorphic computing
- Multi-omics & Bioinformatics — gene networks, multi-omics integration, Agentic AI for biology
- Bio-AI Infrastructure — biomedical databases, knowledge bases, clinical deployment
